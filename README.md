# README

I'm building this to be an automation framework for whastapp using whatsapp web js as a way to interact with the browser.

In fact I use an implementation of whatsapp web js, the wppconnect server [https://wppconnect.io/pt-BR/docs/wppconnect-server] it creates a rest api and a socket to control whatsapp,

I'm still organizing the documentation but I believe the code is easy to understand.

updates coming soon!
